    <h1>Privacy Policy for Clock Out</h1>
    <p>Effective date: July 2025</p>
  </header>


    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Clock Out (“the App”) is developed by Alex Smyntyna and is designed to let
      users track their work hours and earnings. This Privacy Policy explains
      what information the App collects, how it is used, and your choices
      regarding it.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Local Data:</strong> All time entries, shift data, workplace
      details, and notes are stored locally on your device. We do not collect or
      transmit this information to any server.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Optional Address Lookup:</strong> When you add a workplace, you
      may search for an address. Those search queries are handled by your
      device’s built‑in mapping service (e.g., Apple MapKit). Please refer to
      their privacy documentation for details.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Use of Information</h2>
    <p>
      Your data is used solely within the App to provide time‐tracking and
      reporting functionality. No personal information is shared with third
      parties.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage & Security</h2>
    <p>
      All your data remains on your device. The App does not transmit your shift
      logs or personal details to any external server. It is your responsibility
      to back up your device if you wish to preserve your data long‑term.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Third‑Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      Clock Out does not integrate analytics or advertising SDKs. The only
      third‑party interaction occurs if you choose to export shifts as CSV and
      share that file.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect
      personal data from anyone under 13.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. When we do, we will update
      the “Effective date” above. Continued use of the App after changes
      indicates your acceptance of the new terms.
    </p>
